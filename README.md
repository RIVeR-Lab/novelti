# NOVELTI Human Experiment Data

The repository contains the experimental data we collected during NOVELTI human subject experiment.

Due to the upload file size limit, we uploaded the data to Northeastern University Digital Repository Service (DRS).

The data collection can be downloaded from this [link](https://repository.library.northeastern.edu/collections/neu:gm80hz989).

Each entry is named by the following pattern:  
[subject name]-rob-[control method]-[interface]-[route]-1-[Date].zip

In each entry, the following data are included:
- NASA TLX assessment 
- Screen recording during the experiment
- Rosbag of all rostopics
- Individual command mapping and confusion matrix
